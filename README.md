# online-game
a very simple online game as a demonstration of network programming

# How to Run
cd into the `socket-server` directory and run `npm start`
This will start the backend on localhost:9000

cd into the `client` directory and run `npm start`
This will start serving front end on localhost:3000

For users not on the host machine, go to `http://ipaddr:3000`
ipaddr is the local ip address of the host machine

*Note: Need to change the ENDPOINT value in client code to be the respective host machine's ipaddr to work properly
